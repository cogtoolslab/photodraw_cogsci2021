# Visual communication of object concepts at different levels of abstraction

Project investigating our ability to produce drawings of specific entities (e.g., "Garfield") as well as general categories (e.g., "cat").

## Experiment
_______________________________________________________________

We ran a series of experiments examining how sensory information and representational goals jointly constrain the content and form of our drawings. In our first experiment (`experiments/kiddraw`) participants produced a total of 12 drawings, corresponding to 12 familiar basic-level categories, where 6 drawings were cued using a category label and the other 6 were cued using a typical exemplar from that category. 

In the second experiment (`photodraw2x2`) we independently manipulated sensory information (photo/text cue type) and representaional goals (to draw an exemplar vs. a category) to form a 2x2 factorial design. This time, participants drew 32 drawings corresponding, to 32 basic-level categories.
