# photodraw experiments

This directory contains the different experiments in the `photodraw` project. Each subdirectory contains all the necessary code (i.e., HTML/CSS/JavaScript) to actually run the human construction experiments. Node scripts (`node app.js`, `node store.js`) in the main directory control server-side processes.

### `/kiddraw`

In the CogSci 2021 submission, kiddraw corresponds to the section titled _Study 1: How do drawings cued by prototypical exemplars differ from drawings cued by category labels?_

### `photodraw2x2`, containing:
#### `/categorydraw_photo`, `/categorydraw_text`, `/instancedraw_photo`, and `/instancedraw_text`

In the CogSci 2021 submission, these four experiments correspond to the section titled _Study 2: Disentangling the contributions of sensory information, goals, and typicality_. 

### `/photodraw_norming`

In the CogSci 2021 submission, this experiment corresponds to the section under Study 2 titled _Measuring image typicality_.
